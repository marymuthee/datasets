# Master’s Geospatial Datasets Repository

This repository contains curated datasets compiled and prepared during my Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree in Copernicus Master in Digital Earth (CDE).  
It serves as a central storage and reference point for datasets used in coursework, assignments, research, and project work related to Geoinformatics, Earth Observation, and Geodata Science.

## 1. Overview

The repository is designed to support reproducibility, accessibility, and structured management of geospatial datasets used throughout the Master’s program.  
It contains a collection of raster, vector, and tabular datasets covering various themes including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, land use, climate, and socio-economic indicators.

Each dataset is accompanied by relevant metadata describing its origin, format, coordinate reference system (CRS), and intended use.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

1. Maintain an organized and version-controlled collection of datasets used throughout the Master’s journey.  
2. Facilitate quick access to datasets for analytical workflows in Jupyter, Google Colab, or local environments.  
3. Promote reproducibility and traceability of geospatial analyses and experiments.  
4. Provide a structured reference for future research and collaborative work.
